# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE_DATA

I did this project in collaboration with UNP.the Brazilian E-Commerce Dashboard, which provides a clear and insightful look into online shopping trends in Brazil.
The dashboard tracks:
Customers – How many unique customers there are, where they’re located, and their shopping habits.
Orders – Trends over time, order statuses, processing times, and delivery performance.
Pricing & Revenue – Order values, shipping costs, and total revenue to help businesses understand pricing strategies.
Payments – Preferred payment methods, installment usage, and overall payment trends.
Customer Feedback – Review scores and comments to identify satisfaction trends.
By combining multiple datasets, the dashboard helps businesses improve logistics, enhance customer experiences, and make smarter pricing and marketing decisions.

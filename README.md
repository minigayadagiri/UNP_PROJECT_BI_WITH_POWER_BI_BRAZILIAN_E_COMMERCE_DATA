# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE_DATA

I did this project in collaboration with UNP.the Brazilian E-Commerce Dashboard provides a clear and insightful look into online shopping trends in Brazil and
the Dashboard provides key insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and business performance.

The dashboard analyzes the total number of unique customers, their geographic distribution, and shopping trends across different states and cities. It tracks order trends over time, including order statuses, processing times and delivery performance.

Additionally, it examines order pricing, freight costs, and total revenue, helping businesses understand pricing strategies. Payment analysis covers preferred payment methods, installment trends, and total payment values. Customer reviews are also analyzed, identifying satisfaction patterns through review scores and comments.

By integrating multiple datasets, the dashboard offers a comprehensive view of Brazil’s e-commerce landscape. It helps businesses optimize logistics, enhance customer experiences, and refine pricing and marketing strategies, enabling data-driven decision-making in the e-commerce industry.
